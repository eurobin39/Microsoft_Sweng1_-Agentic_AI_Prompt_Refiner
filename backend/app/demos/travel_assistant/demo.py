"""
Travel Assistant Demo — Microsoft Agent Framework

Demonstrates three workflow patterns with structured tracing:
  1. HANDOFF: Triage agent routes to specialists who hand off between each other
  2. SEQUENTIAL: Weather → Packing chain (packing needs weather context)
  3. CONCURRENT: Weather + Activities + Booking agents work in parallel

Each run produces a JSON trace in traces/ for evaluator consumption.

Prerequisites:
  pip install agent-framework --pre azure-identity python-dotenv

  Environment variables (or .env file):
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key       (or use `az login`)
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini
